# Bellybutton_biodiversity

## Plotly_Belly_Button by David Aduaka

The Challenge relates to bacterial species studies occuring in a microbiology laboratory. Roza, an analyst working in this lab, hypothesizes that the bacteria that could produce a suitable beef-flavor substitute resides in the belly buttons of humans. As such, she has taken samples from several candidates, and wants to visualize demographic information, levels of different bacterial species in each candidate, and frequency of washing.

In the challenge, I create a drop-down menu that provides interactivity. When a Test Subject ID Number is selected, the requested information is provided in a table, horizontal bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge.

For modifications, I included

A background picture for the jumbotron,
A background color for the page and font, and
A paragraph explaining the project.
